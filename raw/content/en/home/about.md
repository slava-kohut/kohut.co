Hi! I am Slava Kohut. Welcome to my personal web space. I work as a researcher / data scientist in the (re)insurance industry. Some fun facts about me:

* I grew up in the beautiful country of [Belarus](https://www.belarus.by/en/) and currently live 
in the province of Alberta, Canada.
* I am passionate about science and hold a PhD in Computational Chemistry.  
* I like travelling and photography and often spend my weekends cheering for [AS Roma](https://www.asroma.com/).
